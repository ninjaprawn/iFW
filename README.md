*NOTE:* Thinking of switching from CoreData to Realm, not too sure
Also, I'm currently using Alamofire and SwiftyJSON

iOS app for ipsw.me

Includes notifications and stuff

A lot of stuff todo, got basic API manager working, CoreData main target right now.

MIT cause I don't own any info here, and don't really care what you do with it.

If you do reuse some parts (APIManager), think about dropping a small credit or whatever.

Uses CocoaPods, so pod install when you dl.
